# One Click Metro
This is a 48-hour GameJam project for DIS Copenhagen: Game Development & Lab, by 4 inexperienced game developers (at the time).

"One Click Metro" is, by name, a puzzle game that only requires the player to click the screen. 
The game concept is a little girl trying to get back home using the train, using clues on the screen to help. 
When the player clicks the wrong place too many times, it's game over.
This game was inspired by the Copenhagen underground train system, where the group members were studying abroad.
